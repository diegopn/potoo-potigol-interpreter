# Security Policy

## Supported versions

The `develop` branch is the active development line. Reports affecting `develop` and the latest published release will be considered; older releases may no longer receive security updates.

## Report a vulnerability

Do not publish vulnerability details in issues, pull requests, discussions, or public comments. If GitHub provides the private **Report a vulnerability** form on the repository’s Security page, use it. Otherwise, use the [Potoo contact page](https://diegopn.github.io/#contato) only to request a private reporting channel. Do not include technical details or a proof of concept in that first message.

After arranging a private channel, include the affected version or commit, Rust version, operating system, reproduction steps, impact, and a minimal `Potigol` example. Remove credentials, personal information, and unrelated data.

For non-security issues, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). For conduct concerns, see [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Security boundaries

Programs execute inside the host process and are not an operating-system sandbox. The host implements `RuntimeIo` and controls input, output, cancellation, waiting, debugger behavior, and optional Jerimum services. Resource limits are not a strict memory ceiling. Apply process isolation when running untrusted source in a privileged or shared service; Potigol random functions are not cryptographic. Resource limits reduce excessive execution but do not guarantee isolation or prevent every denial-of-service condition. Keep suitable limits enabled when accepting source from users.

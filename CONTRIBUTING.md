- Keep each pull request focused and describe the change and how to review it.
- List the verification commands you ran.
- Preserve copyright and license notices. Check license compatibility for third-party material and disclose added dependencies with their purpose and license.

## Changes to language behavior

- Add tests for new syntax, runtime behavior, diagnostics, and resource limits where applicable.
